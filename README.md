# Drawing App
An interactive application built with Python.

## About
This is a simple interactive Python app that draws different geometric shapes.  

Users can select one of three different shapes for the app to draw.     

## Project Background
The Drawing app was built as part of the coursework for the "Getting Started with Python" course by Skillcrush. 

The skills practiced during this project include: 

- Modules: Importing and using the external Turtle module to draw three different geometric shapes in the form of a star, a square, and a hexagon.  

- Loops: Using for loops and the range() function to direct the Turtle to create the shape that the user selects from a menu.    

## Built With
- Python
- Turtle module
